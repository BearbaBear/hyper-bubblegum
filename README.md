# hyper-bubblegum
a ~~detrimentally~~ minimalist, bright pink theme for the [Hyper](http://hyper.is/) terminal

does away with useless pieces of ui such as window titles and scroll bars, leaving you with the cleanest terminal possible

## installation

1. open your Hyper preferences file at `~/.hyper.js`
2. add `'hyper-bubblegum'` to the plugins list
